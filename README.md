Suicide is a serious and escalating problem worldwide. According to data collected by WHO, there is one suicide in the world every 40 seconds. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States in 2013, and the 2nd leading cause of death for people age 15-29. I collected suicide data from agencies including WHO, CDC, United States Department of Labor, United States Census Bureau, and United States Agriculture Economic Research Service. I analyzed the data collected and hope to provide an insight to this topic. 
All analysis was done in R. Code can be viewed in Visualization.Projct.Rmd.
